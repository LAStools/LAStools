# LAStools

**Award-winning software for efficient LiDAR processing (with LASzip)**

You find all individual LAStools in the `.\LAStools\bin directory`. Start
them by double-clicking or run them in the DOS command line. The ArcGIS
toolbox can be found in `.\LAStools\ArcGIS_toolbox` and the QGIS toolbox
in `.\LAStools\QGIS_toolbox`. A few example DOS batch scripts can be found
in the `.\LAStools\example_batch_scripts` directory.

## open source tools:

* `laszip.exe` compresses the LAS files in a completely lossless manner
* `lasinfo.exe` prints out a quick overview of the contents of a LAS file
* `lasindex.exe` creates a spatial index LAX file for fast spatial queries
* `las2las.exe` extracts last returns, clips, subsamples, translates, etc ...
* `lasmerge.exe` merges several LAS or LAZ files into a single LAS or LAZ file
* `txt2las.exe` converts LIDAR data from ASCII text to binary LAS format
* `las2txt.exe` turns LAS into human-readable and easy-to-parse ASCII
* `lasprecision.exe` analyses the actual precision of the LIDAR points

## Closed source tools:

* `lastool.exe` is an old GUI for multiple LAStools (now each tool has its own GUI)
* `lasground.exe` extracts the bare-earth by classifying all ground points
* `lasground_new.exe` an improved version of lasground.exe for complex terrains
* `lasoverlap.exe` checks overlap & vertical/horizontal alignment of flight lines
* `lascontrol.exe` quality checks elevations for a list of control points 
* `lasclassify.exe` finds buildings and the vegetation above the ground
* `lascolor.exe` colors the LAS points based on ortho imagery in TIF format 
* `lasgrid.exe` grids onto min/max/avg/std elevation, intensity, or counter rasters
* `lascanopy.exe` computes many raster and plot metrics for forestry applications
* `lasboundary.exe` extracts a boundary polygon that encloses the points
* lasheight.exe` computes for each point its height above the ground
* lastrack.exe` classifies LiDAR point based on distance from a trajectory
* lasplanes.exe` finds planar patches in terrestrial, mobile, (airborne?) scans 
* lasclip.exe` clips points against building footprints / swath boundaries
* lastile.exe` tiles huge amounts of LAS points into square tiles
* lassplit.exe` splits points of LAS file(s) into flightlines or other criteria
* lassort.exe` sorts points by gps_time, point_source, or into spatial proximity
* lasduplicate.exe` removes duplicate points (with identical x and y, z optional) 
* lasthin.exe` thins lowest / highest / random LAS points via a grid
* las2tin.exe` triangulates the points of a LAS file into a TIN
* las2dem.exe` rasters (via a TIN) into elevation/slope/intensity/rgb DEMs
* las2iso.exe` extracts, optionally simplified, elevation contours
* lasview.exe` visualizes a LAS file with a simple OpenGL viewer
* las2shp.exe` turns binary LAS into ESRI's Shapefile format
* shp2las.exe` turns an ESRI's Shapefile into binary LAS

## BLAST extension

* `blast2dem.exe` rasters like las2dem but with streaming TINs for billions of points. 
* `blast2iso.exe` contours like las2iso but with streaming TINs for billions of points. 

For Windows all binaries are included. All open source tools can be compiled
from the source code. For MSVC6.0 there is a project file. For Linux and MacOS
the makefiles are included. Simply go into the root directory and run 'make':

1. `unzip LAStools.zip`
2. `cd LAStools/`
3. `make`

The compiled binary executables are or will be in the `./LAStools/bin directory`.

Please read the `LICENSE.txt` file for information on the legal use and licensing
of LAStools. I would also really like it if you would send me an email and tell me
what you use LAStools for and what features and improvements you could need.
