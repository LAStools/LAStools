# lasinfo

Reports the contents of the header and a short summary of the
points. Warns when there is a difference between the header
information and the point content. When run with option '-cd'
or '-compute_density', lasinfo will compute the point density.

All differences can be repaired with the '-repair' option. The
option '-repair_bb' will only repair (or tighten) the bounding
box while '-repair_counters' will only repair wrong reported
number of points. 

By default the output of lasinfo goes to stderr. The output can
be suppressed with '-quiet' or changed to '-stdout'. To write
to a particular file use '-o output.txt' or '-otxt' which stores
the lasinfo report to "lidar.txt" assuming the file has the name
"lidar.laz". With the option '-odix _info' you change the name
to "lidar_info.txt" and with '-odir E:\reports' you choose a
particular directory. These options are especially useful in
batch mode such as:

lasinfo64 -i *.laz -otxt -odir ..\reports -odix _info -cores 3

In addition, the lasinfo output can be provided in JSON format. To save 
the output to a JSON file, use either the '-ojs' option or specify an output 
file name with the '-o' option and the '.json' extension. The '-js' option can 
be used to output the JSON format directly.

lasinfo64 -i *.laz -ojs -js -o output_file.json

The tool can also be used to modify various other entries in
the header as described below. This needs to be done with care
as such changes can potentially corrupt the file.

In case you just want to report or modify the header entries
you can skip the parsing of the points with '-no_check'. Some
LAS files have excessive amounts of VLRs. You can supress them
being output with '-no_vlrs'. By default lasinfo reports the 
min and the max of every point attribute after parsing all the
points. You can supress this with '-no_min_max'. By default the
tool also counts the points falling outside the header bounding
box. This can be disabled with '-no_check_outside'. If instead
you want to report all the individual points that fall outside
use '-report_outside'. Another interesting option is to report
the GPS time min and max as '-gps_week' in case it is stored as
adjusted Standard GPS time. 

There are a lot of ways that lasinfo can be used to modify the
contents of the LAS header *in place* without copying the file
and the GUI will teach you these command line options. Some not
listed in the GUI are: 

-set_GUID F794F8A4-A23E-421E-A134-ACF7754E1C54
-set_system_identifier "RIEGL Optech Leica"
-set_generating_software "awesome LAStools"
-set_file_source_ID 27
-set_file_creation 8 2007

Querying CRS representations and information, based on the input file.
The [wkt] WKT representation, the [js] PROJJSON representation, the [str] PROJ string, 
the [epsg] EPSG code, the [el] ellipsoid information, the [datum] datum information and 
the [cs] coordinate system information can be queried.
CAREFUL! If a CRS object was not created from a PROJ string, exporting it to a PROJ string will in 
most cases lead to a loss of information. This can potentially lead to incorrect transformations. 
The use of PROJ strings should only be used with advanced knowledge.

### Basics
-help : print help output

### parse
The '-parse [xyz]' flag specifies how to interpret each line of the ASCII file.
For example, 'tsxyzssa' means that the first number is the gpstime, the next
number should be skipped, the next three numbers are the x, y, and z coordinate,
the next two should be skipped, and the next number is the scan angle.

The other supported entries are:  
  x : [x] coordinate  
  y : [y] coordinate  
  z : [z] coordinate  
  t : gps [t]ime  
  R : RGB [R]ed channel  
  G : RGB [G]reen channel  
  B : RGB [B]lue channel  
  I : N[I]R channel of LAS 1.4 point type 8  
  s : [s]kip a string or a number that we don't care about  
  i : [i]ntensity  
  a : scan [a]ngle  
  n : [n]umber of returns of that given pulse  
  r : number of [r]eturn  
  h : with[h]eld flag  
  k : [k]eypoint flag  
  g : synthetic fla[g]  
  o : [o]verlap flag of LAS 1.4 point types 6, 7, 8  
  l : scanner channe[l] of LAS 1.4 point types 6, 7, 8  
  E : terrasolid [E]hco Encoding  
  c : [c]lassification. If extended classes are used: Use o,l or I to force 1.4 format.  
  u : [u]ser data  
  p : [p]oint source ID  
  e : [e]dge of flight line flag  
  d : [d]irection of scan flag  
  0-9 : additional attributes described as extra bytes (0 through 9)  
  (13) : additional attributes described as extra bytes (10 and up)  
  H : a hexadecimal string encoding the RGB color  
  J : a hexadecimal string encoding the intensity  

### output separator
The '-osep [sep]' argument specifies the output format of a text(xyz or csv) output.
Supported [sep] values:

  comma
  tab
  dot
  colon
  semicolon
  hyphen
