# lasheight

This tool computes the height of each LAS point above the
ground. This assumes that grounds points have already been
classified (classification == 2) so they can be identified
and used to construct a ground TIN. The ground points can
also be in an separate file '-ground_points ground.las' or
'-ground_points dtm.csv -parse ssxyz'.

Should the input coordinates be in some representation where
the z-axis does not correspond to elevation, such as in an
earth-centered representation, then the file needs converted
to, for example, a UTM projection first.

The tool reads LIDAR in LAS/LAZ/ASCII format, triangulates
the ground points into a TIN (or whatever point class(es)
were selected with '-class 8' or '-classification 2 8'), and
calculates the elevation of each point with respect to this
TIN. By default the resulting heights are scaled with a factor
of 10.0, quantized & clamped into an unsigned char between
0 and 255, and stored in the "user data" field of each point.
Change the default scale factor of 10.0 with '-scale_u 20.0'
or disable the storage in the "user data" field with option
'-do_not_store_in_user_data' or by storing the height above
the ground as "extra bytes" with '-store_as_extra_bytes' as
an 0.01 scaled signed two-byte short [cm resolution] or with
'-store_precise_as_extra_bytes' as an 0.001 scaled signed
four-byte integer [mm resolution].

Alternatively - to avoid quantizing and clamping - you can
'-replace_z' the elevation value of each point with the computed
height. That means that afterwards all ground points will have
an elevation of zero and all other points will have an elevation
that equals their relative height above (or below) the ground TIN
at their x and y location. In a sense this will "normalize" the
elevations of points in respect to their surrounding ground truth.
If you add the '-replace_z' option the resulting heights are *not*
scaled with a factor of 10.0, quantized & clamped into an unsigned
char between 0 and 255, and stored in the "user data" field of each
point ... unless you add the explicit '-store_in_user_data' option.

You can also use the height to change the point classification
with '-classify_below -1.0 7' or '-classify_above 100.0 10' and
also '-classify_between 0.5 2.0 3 -classify_between 2.0 5.0 4'.

Another alternative is to use the computed height to eliminate
points with a particular ground height above or below a threshold
with the options '-drop_below 1.5' or '-drop_above 6.8'.

You can ignore certain point classes from being dropped and/or
classified with '-ignore_class 6 7'.

If there are too few ground points to construct a ground TIN or
the ground points form a degenerate triangulation no heights can
be computed. By default the files are simply copied (and in case
of '-replace_z' all elevations are zeroed). Alternatively these
files can be skipped with the command-line option '-skip_files'.

This tool can also be used to convert from Geoid to Ellipoidal
heights. For this we need the Geoid model as a grid of points
"geoid.txt", "geoid.las" or "geoid.xyz" whose elevations express
the difference between the ellipsoid and the geoid. Simply run:

lasheight64 -i lidar.las -ground_points geoid.txt -replace_z -odix _geoid

When using external ground points with '-ground_points geoid.laz'
lasheight will *not* use all points in the file but cut out a
"generous portion" surrounding the bounding box of the points
whose height is to be computed. That "generous cutting" may fail
when the 'geoid.laz' file has sparsely spaced points. Using the
'-all_ground_points' option forces lasheight to use all points. 

 
## Examples

    lasheight64 -i *.las

computes heights for all LAS files that match '*.las' and stores
them quantized and clamped into the "user data" field (an 8-bit
unsigned char) of each point record.


    lasheight64 -i *.las -class 3

the same as above but uses points with classification 3 instead
of the default 2 to create the TIN that serves as the reference
elevation against which the heights are computed.


    lasheight64 -i *.laz -olaz

the same as above for LASzip-compressed input and output.


    lasheight64 -i *.las -replace_z

replaces the z coordinate of each point with the computed height
to avoid quantizing and clamping their value at the expense of
losing the original z elevation values.


    lasheight64 -i lidar.las -o brush.las -drop_below 1.0 -drop_above 3.0

kepps only those points who are between 1 and 3 units above the
ground.


    lasheight64 -i lidar.las -o heights.txt -oparse u

stores the heights to a file called 'heights.txt' as quantized
and clamped "unsigned chars".


    lasheight64 -i lidar.las -replace_z -o heights.txt -oparse z

stores the heights to a file called 'heights.txt' as floating-
point values of the same precision as the original elevations.

### parse
The '-parse [xyz]' flag specifies how to interpret each line of the ASCII file.
For example, 'tsxyzssa' means that the first number is the gpstime, the next
number should be skipped, the next three numbers are the x, y, and z coordinate,
the next two should be skipped, and the next number is the scan angle.

The other supported entries are:  
  x : [x] coordinate  
  y : [y] coordinate  
  z : [z] coordinate  
  t : gps [t]ime  
  R : RGB [R]ed channel

  o : [o]verlap flag of LAS 1.4 point types 6, 7, 8  
  l : scanner channe[l] of LAS 1.4 point types 6, 7, 8  
  E : terrasolid [E]hco Encoding  
  c : [c]lassification. If extended classes are used: Use o,l or I to force 1.4 format.  
  u : [u]ser data  
  p : [p]oint source ID  
  e : [e]dge of flight line flag  
  d : [d]irection of scan flag  
  0-9 : additional attributes described as extra bytes (0 through 9)  
  (13) : additional attributes described as extra bytes (10 and up)  
  H : a hexadecimal string encoding the RGB color  
  J : a hexadecimal string encoding the intensity  

### output separator
The '-osep [sep]' argument specifies the output format of a text(xyz or csv) output.
Supported [sep] values:

  comma
  tab
  dot
  colon
  semicolon
  hyphen
  space
