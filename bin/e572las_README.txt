  e572las.exe:

  This tool reads LiDAR in the E57 format from a *.e57 file and
  converts it to either standard LAS, compressed LAZ, or simple
  ASCII TXT.

  By default all scans contained in the E57 file are merged into
  one output with all invalid points being omitted. The points of
  different scans are given different point source IDs so that the
  information which points belong to one scan is preserved.  It's
  possible to request '-split_scans' and '-include_invalid' to put
  points from different scans into separate files and/or to include 
  invalid points as well.

  Another useful option is '-v' or '-verbose' that informs about
  the contents and the progress of processing.

  Below are some typical example command lines for the data that
  can be found here: http://www.libe57.org/data.html

  e572las -v -i pumpACartesian.e57 -o pumpACartesian.laz 
  e572las -v -i Station018.e57 -o Station018.laz -set_scale 0.002 0.002 0.002
  e572las -v -i trimble.e57 -o trimble.laz
  e572las -v -i pump.e57 -o pump.las -split_scans
  e572las -v -i trimble.e57 -o trimble.txt -oparse xyzi
  e572las -v -i pump.e57 -o pump.laz -include_invalid

  By default the tool will apply transformations and/or rotations
  that it find stored in the pose of each scan. You can ask the tool
  not to apply those with '-no_pose'. To selevtively suppress only
  transformation or rotation use '-no_transformation' or '-no_rotation'
