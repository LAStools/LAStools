# lasindex

Creates a *.lax file for a given *.las or *.laz file that
contains spatial indexing information. When this LAX file is
present it will be used to speed up access to the relevant
areas of the LAS/LAZ file whenever a spatial queries of the
type

-inside_tile ll_x ll_y size  
-inside_circle center_x center_y radius  
-inside_rectangle min_x min_y max_x max_y  (or simply -inside)  

appears in the command line of any LAStools invocation. This
acceleration is also available to users of the LASlib API. The
LASreader class has three new functions called

BOOL inside_tile(F32 ll_x, F32 ll_y, F32 size);  
BOOL inside_circle(F64 center_x, F64 center_y, F64 radius);  
BOOL inside_rectangle(F64 min_x, F64 min_y, F64 max_x, F64 max_y);  

if any of these functions is called the LASreader will only
return the points that fall inside the specified region and
use - when available - the spatial indexing information in the
LAX file created by lasindex.

You can also '-append' the LAX file to the end of the LAZ file.

If some but not all of your LAS or LAZ files are already indexed
and you do not want to reindex those, then you can add the option
'-dont_reindex' to the command line which will only process those
LAS or LAZ files that are not indexed yet.


## Examples

    lasindex64 -i in.laz

creates a spatial indexing file called 'in.lax' that need to be
in the same folder as the file 'in.laz' to be useful. If you
modify the spatial location, the number of points, or their order
in the file then you need to recreate the LAX file.


    lasindex64 -i *.laz

creates a spatial indexing file for all LAZ files *.laz


    lasindex64 -i *.laz -append

creates a spatial indexing file for all LAZ files *.laz and appends
them to then end of the LAZ file (not possible when indexing LAS)


    lasindex64 -i *.laz -dont_reindex

creates a spatial indexing file for all LAZ files *.laz that do
not yet have a LAX file


lasindex64 -h  
lasindex64 -i lidar.las  
lasindex64 -i *.las  
lasindex64 -i flight1*.las flight2*.las -v  
lasindex64 -i lidar.las -tile_size 2 -maximum -50

### parse
The '-parse [xyz]' flag specifies how to interpret each line of the ASCII file.
For example, 'tsxyzssa' means that the first number is the gpstime, the next
number should be skipped, the next three numbers are the x, y, and z coordinate,
the next two should be skipped, and the next number is the scan angle.

The other supported entries are:  
  x : [x] coordinate  
  y : [y] coordinate  
  z : [z] coordinate  
  t : gps [t]ime  
  R : RGB [R]ed channel  
  G : RGB [G]reen channel  
  B : RGB [B]lue channel  
  I : N[I]R channel of LAS 1.4 point type 8  
  s : [s]kip a string or a number that we don't care about  
  i : [i]ntensity  
  a : scan [a]ngle  
  n : [n]umber of returns of that given pulse  
  r : number of [r]eturn  
  h : with[h]eld flag  
  k : [k]eypoint flag  
  g : synthetic fla[g]  
  o : [o]verlap flag of LAS 1.4 point types 6, 7, 8  
  l : scanner channe[l] of LAS 1.4 point types 6, 7, 8  
  E : terrasolid [E]hco Encoding  
  c : [c]lassification. If extended classes are used: Use o,l or I to force 1.4 format.  
  u : [u]ser data  
  p : [p]oint source ID  
  e : [e]dge of flight line flag  
  d : [d]irection of scan flag  
  0-9 : additional attributes described as extra bytes (0 through 9)  
  (13) : additional attributes described as extra bytes (10 and up)  
  H : a hexadecimal string encoding the RGB color  
  J : a hexadecimal string encoding the intensity
