﻿# lasthin

A fast LIDAR thinning algorithm for LAS/LAZ/ASCII. It places
a uniform grid over the points and within each grid cell keeps
only the point with the lowest (or '-highest' or '-random') Z
coordinate. When keeping '-random' points you can in addition
specify a '-seed 232' for the random generator. You can also
keep the point that is closest to the center of each cell with
the option '-central'.

Instead of removing the thinned out points from the output file
you can also request to classify them with '-classify_as 8' or
mark thinned out points by flagging them as '-flag_as_withheld'
Later use the '-drop_withheld' or '-keep_withheld' filters to
get either the thinned points or their complement. You can also
use '-flag_as_keypoint' to flag all the points that survive the
thinning operation.

For adaptive thinning use '-adaptive 0.2 5.0' where 0.2 specifies
the vertical tolerance that a TIN through the thinned points is
allowed to deviate from the complete set of points and 5.0 the
maximum distance between points. The default for the latter is
10.0 if you only specify '-adaptive 0.15'.

For 2 meter iso-contour creation you can optimize the thinning
with '-contours 2.0'. This is in addition to deciding on a good
step size with '-step 0.5'. It will choose the surviving points
to be vertically as far away as possible from the contours which
tends to result in cleaner, less jaggy countours.

Alternatively use the ‘-percentile 40’ mode to select the point
that is closest to the specified percentile of 40 of all point
elevations within a grid cell. Using the more elaborate version
‘-percentile 40 10’ will in addition only act when there are at
least 10 points in that cell.

In order to process very large but sparse grids such as, for
example, a single but very long diagonal flight line, it is
beneficial to use the '-sparse' option to avoid exceeding the
main memory (and start thrashing).

It is also possible to "thicken" your points as you thin them
to simulate a diameter for the laser beam. The '-subcircle 0.1'
option will replicate each point 8 times in a discrete circle
with radius 0.1 around every original input point. This makes
sense in combination with '-highest' in order to create a nice
set of points for subsequent CHM or DSM construction. By adding
a second value '-subcircle 0.2 -0.05' you can lower of raise the
z value of the 8 points on the discrete circle by the specified
amount, here they would be 0.05 units lower than the original,
which might be useful for subsequent tree top detection.

You can exclude certain point classes from the thinning with
option '-ignore_class 2' or '-ignore_class 3 4 5 6' and they
will all be written back to the thinned file. Then the thinning 
operation will be applied exclusively to the other points.

Obviously you can always combine filtering, for example to keep
only last returns ('-last_only') or to keep only two particular
classifications ('-keep_class 2 8'), with the thinning. There
are many other filters to choose from. Simply run 'lasthin64 -h'
to lists them all.

The grid spacing default is 1 unit and it can be changed, for
example to 5 units, with '-step 5'.
 
 
## Examples

    lasthin64 -i *.las -odix _thinned

thins all LAS files with the grid spacing default of 1 unit
and keeps the lowest point per grid cell and forms output file
names by adding appendix '_thinned' to the input file names.


    lasthin64 -i *.laz -odix _thinned -olaz

same as above but with LAZ files


    lasthin64 -i *.txt -iparse xyzt -oparse xyzt -odix _thinned -otxt

same as above but with ASCII files


    lasthin64 -i in.las -o out.las

does LAS thinning with the grid spacing default of 1 unit
and keeps the lowest point per grid cell


    lasthin64 -i in.las -o out.las -highest -step 2.0

does point thinning with a grid spacing of 2.0 units and
keeps the highest point per grid cell


    lasthin64 -i in.laz -step 0.5 -o out.laz -random

does point thinning with a grid spacing of 0.5 units and
keeps a random point per grid cell


    lasthin64 -i in.laz -adaptive 0.2 5.0 -o out.laz

thins out all points that can be removed from a TIN without 
deviating more than 0.2 vertical units from the original while
keeping the maximum horizontal distance to 5.0 units.


    lasthin64 -i in.laz -ignore_class 1 3 4 5 6 7 9 -adaptive 0.1 -classify_as 8 -o out.laz

intends to only operate on ground points (class 8) and classifies
those points with classification code 8 that form a TIN that deviates
less than 0.1 vertical units from the original TIN while keeping the
maximum horizontal distance between points to 10.0 units.


    lasthin64 -i in.laz -step 5.0 -percentile 50 20 -classify_as 8 -o out.laz -random

keeps all the points but sets the classification of the point
that is closest to the 50th percentile in z to 8. this is
done in each 5.0 unit by 5.0 unit cell with 20 or more points


    lasthin64 -i in.laz -step 0.5 -o out.laz -sparse

does point thinning with a grid spacing of 0.5 units using
a sparse grid representation


    lasthin64 -i in.las -o out.las -highest -step 0.5 -subcircle 0.15

does point thinning with a grid spacing of 0.5 units but
thickens every input point by adding a discrete ring of 8
new points that form a circle with radius 0.15 around the
input point before and then keeps only the highest of those
points per grid cell


    lasthin64 -i in.laz -o out.laz -first_only

does LIDAR thinning with a grid spacing of 1 unit but keeps
the highest points while considering only first returns


    lasthin64 -i in.las -o out.las -keep_class 2 -keep_class 3

looks only at the points classfied as 2 or 3 from in.las and
thins them with a grid spacing of 1 unit 


    lasthin64 -i file_list.txt -lof -o combined.laz

looks at all the points from all the LAS or LAZ files listed
in the text file 'file_list.txt', thins them with a grid
spacing of 1 unit and outputs them compressed to 'combined.laz'

### parse
The '-parse [xyz]' flag specifies how to interpret each line of the ASCII file.
For example, 'tsxyzssa' means that the first number is the gpstime, the next
number should be skipped, the next three numbers are the x, y, and z coordinate,
the next two should be skipped, and the next number is the scan angle.

The other supported entries are:  
  x : [x] coordinate  
  y : [y] coordinate  
  z : [z] coordinate  
  t : gps [t]ime  
  R : RGB [R]ed channel

  o : [o]verlap flag of LAS 1.4 point types 6, 7, 8  
  l : scanner channe[l] of LAS 1.4 point types 6, 7, 8  
  E : terrasolid [E]hco Encoding  
  c : [c]lassification. If extended classes are used: Use o,l or I to force 1.4 format.  
  u : [u]ser data  
  p : [p]oint source ID  
  e : [e]dge of flight line flag  
  d : [d]irection of scan flag  
  0-9 : additional attributes described as extra bytes (0 through 9)  
  (13) : additional attributes described as extra bytes (10 and up)  
  H : a hexadecimal string encoding the RGB color  
  J : a hexadecimal string encoding the intensity  

### output separator
The '-osep [sep]' argument specifies the output format of a text(xyz or csv) output.
Supported [sep] values:

  comma
  tab
  dot
  colon
  semicolon
  hyphen
  space
