# las2las

reads and writes LIDAR data in LAS/LAZ/ASCII format to filter,
transform, project, thin, or otherwise modify its contents.

Sometimes it is not neccessary to use las2las prior other
lastools, because most arguments can be used by the other
tool as well.

Examples are keeping only those points that are within a
rextangle '-keep_xy 10 10 20 20' or points that are between
a certain height '-keep_z 10 100', or dropping points that
are a certain return '-drop_return 2', that have a scan angle
above some threshold '-drop_scan_angle_above 5', or below some
intensity '-drop_intensity_below 15'. Sometimes points are far
outside the bounding box (corrupted files) and it is handy to
remove them with '-crop_to_bounding_box'.

Another typical use is extract only first (-first_only) or only
last (-last_only) returns. Extracting the first return is the
same as dropping all others (e.g. -drop_return 2 3 4 5).

Or one can extract a subsequence of 1000 points (-subseq 540 1000)
which will start at point 540.

It is also possible to keep or drop certain classifications.
The option -keep_class 2 3 will keep only those points that are
of classification 2 or 3 and the option -drop_class 2 3 will drop
only those points. For all options run 'las2las -h'.

## projections

las2las can add missing projection information to the LAS/LAZ file
or reproject (using the same ellipsoid) for example from latitude/longitude
to UTM or the stateplane of Ohio_North or to Earth-centered Earth-fixed (ECEF).
You can also use common EPSG codes with '-epsg 32754'. 
For LAS 1.4 it is important to '-set_ogc_wkt' or '-set_proj_wkt' which translates
the GeoTIFF keys into an CRS string in the OGC WKT format and adds them
as the payload of the corresponding VLR.

## las2las with PROJ

Using the PROJ library it is possible to transform between 
different Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) using the argument '-proj_epsg'.
Specifying the source CRS is optional for all commands. If no source CRS is
specified, the tool will attempt to extract this information from the header of
the input file 
'in.laz', which is recommended.
There is a hierarchy for determining the source CRS for the PROJ transformation:
1. the source CRS is passed as an argument.
2. if not, the WKT is searched for in the header of the source file.
3. if no WKT is available, it is generated from the GeoTIFF data.
4. if this is not possible, the EPSG code from the GeoTIFF is used, which can
   lead to inaccuracies as GeoTIFF arguments could be ignored.

Files with CompoundCRS are not yet supported for transformations using PROJ in
LAStools.
The recommended methods for specifying CRSs are the use of EPSG codes or 
WKT representations, as these adhere to well-defined standards:
 
    las2las64 -i in.laz -o out.laz -proj_epsg 32633 4326
    las2las64 -i in.laz -o out.laz -proj_wkt filename_source_wkt filename_target_wkt

The methods using the json representation or the PROJ string are only recommended 
for advanced and experienced users. When using the PROJ string, a single PROJ string 
can also be used directly to describe the transformation or operation.

    las2las64 -i in.laz -o out.laz -proj_json filename_source_json filename_target_json
    las2las64 -i in.laz -o out.laz -proj_string "proj_string_source" "proj_string_target"

## Offset
The following options are available for automatically setting a sensible offset of
the point coordinates to avoid overflows:

-auto_reoffset: This option sets an appropriate offset in the header and
translates the points accordingly. 
This option is only considered for LAS/LAZ input files and is recommended as long
as no point coordinate operation or transformation is performed.

-offset_adjust: This option sets the offset based on the selected point coordinate
operations and transformations. 
It is recommended to be used for such operations and transformations and is
applicable to all supported input file formats.


## Examples

    las2las64 -i s1885565.laz -o out.laz -sp83 OH_S -feet -elevation_feet

Adding the projection information to the file 's1885565.laz'. This
will not modify the points but merely change the projection VLR in the
header to contain these four geokeys:

  GeoKeyDirectoryTag version 1.1.0 number of keys 4  
  - key 1024 value_offset 1 - GTModelTypeGeoKey: ModelTypeProjected  
  - key 3072 value_offset 32123 - ProjectedCSTypeGeoKey: PCS_NAD83_Ohio_South

    las2las64 -i s1885565.laz -o out.laz -sp83 OH_S -feet -elevation_feet -target_utm auto

Reprojects the points from the Ohio_South NAD83 state plane with all units
in feet to NAD83 UTM coordinates with all units in meter and sets these four
geokeys as the projection information:

  - key 1024 value_offset 1 - GTModelTypeGeoKey: ModelTypeProjected  
  - key 3072 value_offset 26917 - ProjectedCSTypeGeoKey: PCS_NAD83_UTM_zone_17N

in feet to geographic coordinates with x being longitude and y latitude and
sets these three geokeys as the projection information:

  GeoKeyDirectoryTag version 1.1.0 number of keys 3  
  - key 1024 value_offset 2 - GTModelTypeGeoKey: ModelTypeGeographic  
  - key 2048 value_offset 4269 - GeographicTypeGeoKey: GCS_NAD83  
  - key 4099 value_offset 9001 - VerticalUnitsGeoKey: Linear_Meter

points are stored with for the checks (and not the double-precision floating 
point coordinates they represent). Drops all the points of in.laz that have 
point.Z<1000 or point.Z>4000 and stores all surviving points to out.laz 
(use lasinfo.exe to see the range of point.Z).

### parse
The '-parse [xyz]' flag specifies how to interpret each line of the ASCII file.
For example, 'tsxyzssa' means that the first number is the gpstime, the next
number should be skipped, the next three numbers are the x, y, and z coordinate,
the next two should be skipped, and the next number is the scan angle.

The other supported entries are:  
  x : [x] coordinate  
  y : [y] coordinate  
  z : [z] coordinate  
  X : unscaled raw [X] value  
  Y : unscaled raw [Y] value  
  Z : unscaled raw [Z] value

  s : [s]kip a string or a number that we don't care about  
  i : [i]ntensity  
  a : scan [a]ngle  
  n : [n]umber of returns of that given pulse  
  r : number of [r]eturn  
  h : with[h]eld flag  
  k : [k]eypoint flag  
  g : synthetic fla[g]  
  o : [o]verlap flag of LAS 1.4 point types 6, 7, 8  
  l : scanner channe[l] of LAS 1.4 point types 6, 7, 8  
  m : point index, starting at 0
  M : point index, starting at 1
  W : all wavepacket attributes
  w : [w]avepacket descriptor index
  c : [c]lassification. If extended classes are used: Use o,l or I to force 1.4 format.. If extended classes are used: Use o,l or I to force 1.4 format.
  u : [u]ser data  
  p : [p]oint source ID  
  e : [e]dge of flight line flag  
  d : [d]irection of scan flag
