# lasoverlap

This tool reads LIDAR points from LAS/LAZ/ASCII/BIN/SHP and checks the 
flight line overlap and / or the vertical and horizontal alignment. 
Do not add  '-files_are_flightlines' or '-faf' to the command-line if the
 input is tiles. Only use these command-line switches when files *are* 
flight lines.   
The most important parameter '-step n' specifies the n x n area that of 
LiDAR points that are gridded on one raster (or pixel) that are then used
 for doing the overlap and/or difference calculations. The output is 
either in BIL, ASC, IMG, TIF, PNG, JPG, XYZ,or DTM format. When computing
 the difference in the flight line overlaps, by default the tool will 
check '-elevation_lowest', but '-intensity_highest', or '-counter' are 
possible too.

By default the tools create visualization images rather than alignment 
difference rasters or overlap counter grids. There are three ways to 
specify how to visualize the differences:

1. Use '-min_diff 0.1' and '-max_diff 0.2' to specify that elevation 
   differences of up to +/- 10 cm are okay (get mapped to white) but 
   differences of over +/- 20 cm are critical (get mapped to red or blue). 
   Differences between min and max increase in saturation shades of red or 
   blue.

2. Use '-bands 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4' to map differences from 0 up to +/- 10 cm
   to white, up to +/- 20 cm to blue, up to +/- 20 cm to green, up to +/- 
   30 cm to yellow, and above +/- 40 cm to red. 

3. Use with '-color_bands 0.15 0x00FF00 0.4 0xFFA500' to map differences 
   from 0 up to +/- 15 cm to white, up to +/- 40 cm to green, and above +/- 
   40 cm to orange. 

When the input are already tiled flightlines that do not have flight line 
information in the point source ID then the option '-recover_flightlines' 
may be useful that tries to use the GPS time stamp of each point to resolve 
which points are from the same flightline.

Optionally, a KML file is generated that allows the resulting raster  to 
be immediately displayed inside a geospatial context provided by Google 
Earth (for TIF/PNG/JPG images). In case the LAS/LAZ file contains 
projection information (i.e. geo keys as variable length records) this 
metadata is used to correctly geo-reference the KML file. It is also 
possible to provide the proper geo-referencing information in the 
command-line.

Use '-subsample n' with 1 < n < 5 to anti-alias the gridding of LiDAR 
points by their x and y coordinate into disjunct rasters.
The option '-subsample 3' adds each LiDAR point 9 times to the raster at 
locations (x/y), (x+0.33*step/y), (x+0.66*step/y),
(x/y+0.33*step) (x+0.33*step/y+0.33*step) (x+0.66*step/y+0.33*step), 
(x/y+0.66*step) (x+0.33*step/y+0.66*step) (x+0.66*step/y+0.66*step) and 
thereby "washes out" hard boundaries.


## Examples

    lasoverlap64 -i tile.las -step 2 -o overlap.png

creates an overlap raster as well as a difference raster with a step of 2 
units. For this, it is necessary that the LiDAR points in the LAS file 
have their point source ID populated with the flight line ID. The overlap 
raster uses the default color ramp which maps overlap counts from 0 to 5 
to a different colors. The difference raster uses the default color ramp 
that maps blue to -2.5, white to 0, and red to 2.5. The default output 
is PNG.


    lasoverlap64 -i tile.las -step 2 -values -oasc

same as above but output the actual values into an ASC raster (instead of 
the color-coded values into a PNG).


    lasoverlap64 -i tile.las -step 2 -values -oasc -recover_flightlines

same as above for the case the tile does not have proper information in 
the point source ID field but has valid GPS time stamps. The GPS time 
stamps are then used to recover the flight line information by looking 
for continous segments (or rather interruptions) in the GPS time stamps.


    lasoverlap64 -i LDR*.las -files_are_flightlines -step 3 ^
             -min_diff 0.1 -max_diff 0.4 -o overlap.png

merges all the files "LDR*.las" while assigning the points of each file 
a unique point source ID (aka flight line number), and then creates an 
overlap raster as well as a difference raster with a step of 3 units. 
The overlap raster uses the default range of 5 overlaps lines for the 
color ramp. The difference raster uses '-min_diff 0.1' and '-max_diff 
0.4' which maps the range (-0.4 ... -0.1) to (blue ... white) and the 
range (0.1 ... 0.4) to (white ... red). The range (-0.1 ... 0.1) is 
mapped to white.  


    lasoverlap64 -i LDR*.las -files_are_flightlines -step 3 ^
             -min_diff 1.0 -max_diff 2.0 -o overlap.png

same as above. But here the difference raster uses '-min_diff 1' and 
'-max_diff 2' to map range (-2 ... -1) to color ramp (blue ... white), 
range (-1 ... +1) to white and (+1 ... +2) to (white ... red).


    lasoverlap64 -i LDR*.las -files_are_flightlines -step 2 ^
             -max_diff 0.5 -no_over

same as above but does not output an overlap raster ('-no_over') and 
operates with different '-step 2' and '-max_diff 0.5' settings.


    lasoverlap64 -i LDR*.las -files_are_flightlines -step 5 -no_diff

same as above but does not output a difference raster ('-no_diff') but 
only a coarse (-step 5) overlap raster.


    lasoverlap64 -i tiles*.laz -step 2 -no_over -utm 15N

operates tile by tile (e.g. creates one difference raster per file) and 
generates a Google Earth KML file for each tile using UTM 15N. It is 
necessary that the LiDAR points in the LAZ file have their point source 
ID populated.


    lasoverlap64 -i tiles*.laz -step 2 -no_over -utm 15N ^
             -intensity -highest

same as above but computes intensity differences. For intensities the 
difference raster maps range -255 ... 0 ... 255 (e.g. '-max_diff 255').


    lasoverlap64 -i tiles*.laz -keep_last -step 2 -no_over ^
             -utm 15N -counter -highest

same as above but computes last return count differences. For counts the 
difference raster maps range -100 ... 0 ... 100 (e.g. '-max_diff 100').

-force_bigTif            : force output in BigTIFF format, regardless of data size. Used in combination with GeoTIFF output  
-pipe_on                 : write output to command pipe, see also -std_in  
-populate                : populate header on output  
-target_ecef             : output is geocentric (Earth-centered Earth-fixed)

### parse
The '-parse [xyz]' flag specifies how to interpret each line of the ASCII file.
For example, 'tsxyzssa' means that the first number is the gpstime, the next
number should be skipped, the next three numbers are the x, y, and z coordinate,
the next two should be skipped, and the next number is the scan angle.

The other supported entries are:  
  x : [x] coordinate  
  y : [y] coordinate  
  z : [z] coordinate  
  t : gps [t]ime  
  R : RGB [R]ed channel  
  G : RGB [G]reen channel  
  B : RGB [B]lue channel  
  I : N[I]R channel of LAS 1.4 point type 8  
  s : [s]kip a string or a number that we don't care about  
  i : [i]ntensity  
  a : scan [a]ngle  
  n : [n]umber of returns of that given pulse  
  r : number of [r]eturn  
  h : with[h]eld flag  
  k : [k]eypoint flag  
  g : synthetic fla[g]  
  o : [o]verlap flag of LAS 1.4 point types 6, 7, 8  
  l : scanner channe[l] of LAS 1.4 point types 6, 7, 8  
  E : terrasolid [E]hco Encoding  
  c : [c]lassification. If extended classes are used: Use o,l or I to force 1.4 format.  
  u : [u]ser data  
  p : [p]oint source ID  
  e : [e]dge of flight line flag  
  d : [d]irection of scan flag  
  0-9 : additional attributes described as extra bytes (0 through 9)  
  (13) : additional attributes described as extra bytes (10 and up)  
  H : a hexadecimal string encoding the RGB color  
  J : a hexadecimal string encoding the intensity  

### output separator
The '-osep [sep]' argument specifies the output format of a text(xyz) output.
Supported [sep] values:

  comma
  tab
  dot
  colon
  semicolon
  hyphen
  space
