# lasdiff

compares the LIDAR data of two LAS/LAZ/ASCII files and reports
whether they are identical or whether they are different.
 
## Examples

    lasdiff64 -i lidar.las -i lidar.laz

verifies the original LAS file and the compressed LAZ file are
identical and if not prints out differences.

    lasdiff64 -i lidar1.las -i lidar2.las -o lidar3.las 

in case two LiDAR files contain the same points that are in the
same order it can be interesting to compute a possible elevation 
difference that will then be stored in lidar3.las

here is an interesting example application for that using the
data from the C:\lastools\data folder that is included in the
lastools.zip distribution.

1. first we create a digital surface model (DSM)

    las2dem64 -i ..\data\fusa.laz -step 2 -first_only -o dsm.asc

2. then we create a digital terrain model (DTM)

    las2dem64 -i ..\data\fusa.laz -step 2 -keep_class 2 -o dtm.asc

3. now we create a difference of the two

    lasdiff64 -i dsm.asc -i dtm.asc -o nsm.las
    lasdiff64 -i dsm.asc -i dtm.asc -o nsm.xyz

4. if the two rasters were identical then all z coordinates
would be zero. the variation in z coordinate can be used to
derive whatever answer is of interest. in this example here
the variation in z coordinate represents a normalized surface
model (NSM).

### parse
The '-parse [xyz]' flag specifies how to interpret
each line of the ASCII file. For example, 'tsxyzssa'
means that the first number is the gpstime, the next
number should be skipped, the next three numbers are
the x, y, and z coordinate, the next two should be
skipped, and the next number is the scan angle.

The other supported entries are:  
  x : [x] coordinate  
  y : [y] coordinate  
  z : [z] coordinate  
  t : gps [t]ime  
  R : RGB [R]ed channel  
  G : RGB [G]reen channel  
  B : RGB [B]lue channel  
  I : N[I]R channel of LAS 1.4 point type 8  
  s : [s]kip a string or a number that we don't care about  
  i : [i]ntensity  
  a : scan [a]ngle  
  n : [n]umber of returns of that given pulse  
  r : number of [r]eturn  
  h : with[h]eld flag  
  k : [k]eypoint flag  
  g : synthetic fla[g]  
  o : [o]verlap flag of LAS 1.4 point types 6, 7, 8  
  l : scanner channe[l] of LAS 1.4 point types 6, 7, 8  
  E : terrasolid [E]hco Encoding  
  c : [c]lassification  
  u : [u]ser data  
  p : [p]oint source ID  
  e : [e]dge of flight line flag  
  d : [d]irection of scan flag  
  0-9 : additional attributes described as extra bytes (0 through 9)  
  (13) : additional attributes described as extra bytes (10 and up)  
  H : a hexadecimal string encoding the RGB color  
  J : a hexadecimal string encoding the intensity  

### output separator
The '-osep [sep]' argument specifies the output format of a text(xyz or csv) output.
Supported [sep] values:

  comma
  tab
  dot
  colon
  semicolon
  hyphen
  space
