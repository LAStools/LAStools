# lascanopy

This tool reads LiDAR from LAS/LAZ/BIN/SHP/QFIT/ASCII, computes
popular forestry metrics, and grids them onto a raster. A very
important parameter is '-step n' that specifies the n x n area
of LiDAR points that are gridded on one raster (or pixel). The
default of step is 20. The output can be either in BIL, ASC, IMG,
TIF, XYZ, FLT, or DTM format. New is raster output in CSV format
where you can request the '-centroids' to be added. In order to
shift the raster grid that the points are binned into away from
the default alignment of (0/0) to (5/15) use '-grid_ll 5 15'.

If your input files are plots you can use the '-files_are_plots'
option. Here you can ask for the file '-names' to be added to
the output CSV file. You can also query a list of circular plots
from a text file with each line listing: "center_x center_y radius"
with a command like:

lascanopy64 -i forest\*.laz -loc circles.txt -cov -p 50 95 -o plots.csv

And if you want to override the radius then you can do this by
adding a fix radius with '-loc_radius 2' or '-loc_radius 7.5'
to the command above. It is also possible to use text files
where each line consists of "name center_x center_y radius" as
the list of circular plots. Then add '-names' before '-loc' to
handle this correctly.

You can also query a list of rectangular plots from a text
file with each line listing: "min_x min_y max_x max_y" with a
command like:

lascanopy64 -i forest\*.laz -lor rectangles.txt -dns -gap -b 50 75 -o stands.csv

It is also possible to use text files where each line consists
of "name min_x min_y max_x max_y" as the list of rectangular
plots. Then add '-names' before '-lor' to handle this correctly.

You can also load more general polygonal plots from a shapefile with

lascanopy64 -i forest\*.laz -lop polygons.shp -int_p 25 50 75 -centroids -o results.csv

If the SHP file with plots has a DBF file with  that contain either an
integer number or a string attributes for each plot you can add the name
or the index of the field to the argument as shown below:

-lop polygons.shp plot_ID
-lop polygons.shp 3

The tool can concurrently compute a number height percentiles
('-p 5 10 25 50 75 90'), the '-min', the '-max', the average
'-avg', and the standard deviation '-std' of all heights above
the cutoff that by default is breast height of 1.37. It can be
changed with the option '-height_cutoff 2.0'. Also the skewness
with '-ske', the kurtosis with '-kur', and the average square
height '-qav' can be computed. All these statistical metrics
only consider the points above the height cutoff. You can compute
the number of points that actually are above the cutoff and are
participating in the computation with '-abv' and the total number
of points (including those that are below the cutoff) with '-all'.

With the command '-s_upper 95' you can limit the computation of
these statistics -qav -avg -ske -kur -std to use only the highest
95 percent of the points above the height cutoff.

There is also the concept of height "bincentiles" where '-b 90'
would deliver the percentage or fraction of points between the
height cutoff (aka breast height) and the maximum height. Hence
the results may not be what you want for '-height_cutoff -2'.
To utilize all of the points for the bincentile calculation use
'-height_cutoff 0' and the transform '-clamp_z_below 0.0'. There
is also option '-b_upper 97' that specifies a certain height
percentile to be used instead of the maximum height as "upper"
limit for the bins. This metric is sometimes also referred to
as "deciles". Request multiple bincentiles with '-b 50 75 90'.

The tool can also produce the canopy cover using option '-cov'.
The canopy cover is computed as the number of first returns
above the cover cutoff divided by the number of all first
returns and output as a percentage. Similarly, with the option
'-dns' the canopy density can be produced. The canopy density
is computed as the number of all points above the cover cutoff
divided by the number of all returns. By default this cover 
cutoff is identical to the height cutoff. However, using the
option '-cover_cutoff 5.0' you can set it to a lower or a
higher value. As the output default percentages between 0.0%
and 100.0% are produced. Use option '-fractions' to produce
fractions between 0.000 and 1.000 instead. 

It is possible to compute the inverse of the canopy cover and
canopy density with the '-gap' option which will give you 100%
(or for fractions 1.0) minus canopy cover or canopy density.

In addition, the tool can also concurrently produce several
height count rasters. The option '-c 0.5 2 4 10 50', for example,
would compute four rasters that count the points whose heights
are falling into the intervals: 
[0.5, 2), [2, 4), [4, 10), and [10, 50). 
In the same manner the option '-d 0.5 2 4 10 50' will
produce a relative height density raster in which the counts are
divided by the total number of points and scaled to a percentage.

The Vertical Complexity Index (VCI) is also implemented and can
be computed for different vertical bin sizes with '-vc 1 2 4' or
'-vci 2.5 5.0'.

The height & intensity metric known as "Height of Median Energy"
or "HOME" can be computed via the switch '-hom'. All points above
the height cutoff are ordered by their elevation. Then the height
is computed at which the sum of intensities of points below and
the sum of intensities of points above is identical.

Metrics also exist for intensities and '-int_min' and '-int_max'
do the obvious, just like '-int_avg', '-int_qav', '-int_std',
'-int_ske' or '-int_kur'. Similarly you can produce intensity
percentiles with '-int_p 25 50 75' or intensity counts as well
as densities using the corresponding '-int_c 0 128 256 1024' or
'-int_d 0 128 256 1024'.

By default the generated raster spans the extend of the header
bounding box. You can use the bounding box of the tile with
'-use_tile_bb' (which only makes sense if the LAS/LAZ file was
generated using lastile) or the original bounding box in case
of a buffered tile with '-use_orig_bb' (which only makes sense
if the input has an on-the-fly buffer aka '-buffered 50'). The
extend can also be defined by setting '-ll min_x min_y' plus
'-ncols 512' and '-nrows 512'.

For the height_cutoff to make sense it is important that the input
is height normalized, meaning that the z coordinate of each point
corresponds to the height above ground and not the elevation of
the point. With 'lasheight -i in.laz -replace_z -o out.laz' you
can height-normalize a ground-classified LiDAR file.

Depending on the height cutoff or the input file it is possible
that generated rasters contain only 'no data' values but not a
single real value. Adding option '-remove_empty_rasters' to the
command line will delete those files from disk.

## Examples

    lascanopy64 -i *.las -min -max -avg

for each *.las files and for all height above 1.37 it computes
the minimum, maximum, and average value from all points that fall
into cells of size 20 by 20 and stores the resulting grid in ASC
format using the endings '_min.asc', '_max.asc', '_avg.asc'.

    lascanopy64 -i lidar*.laz -merged -p 20 40 60 80 -step 10 -o dem.bil

merges the points of all files that match the wildcard lidar*.laz
on-the-fly into one file and computes for all heights above 1.37
the 20th, 40th, 60th, and 80th percentile for 10 by 10 grid cells
and stores the resulting rasters in BIL format using the endings
'_p20.bil', '_p40.bil', '_p60.bil', and '_p80.bil'.

### parse
The '-parse [xyz]' flag specifies how to interpret
each line of the ASCII file. For example, 'tsxyzssa'
means that the first number is the gpstime, the next
number should be skipped, the next three numbers are
the x, y, and z coordinate, the next two should be
skipped, and the next number is the scan angle.

The other supported entries are:  
  x : [x] coordinate  
  y : [y] coordinate  
  z : [z] coordinate  
  t : gps [t]ime  
  R : RGB [R]ed channel  
  G : RGB [G]reen channel  
  B : RGB [B]lue channel  
  I : N[I]R channel of LAS 1.4 point type 8  
  s : [s]kip a string or a number that we don't care about  
  i : [i]ntensity  
  a : scan [a]ngle  
  n : [n]umber of returns of that given pulse  
  r : number of [r]eturn  
  h : with[h]eld flag  
  k : [k]eypoint flag  
  g : synthetic fla[g]  
  o : [o]verlap flag of LAS 1.4 point types 6, 7, 8  
  l : scanner channe[l] of LAS 1.4 point types 6, 7, 8  
  E : terrasolid [E]hco Encoding  
  c : [c]lassification  
  u : [u]ser data  
  p : [p]oint source ID  
  e : [e]dge of flight line flag  
  d : [d]irection of scan flag  
  0-9 : additional attributes described as extra bytes (0 through 9)  
  (13) : additional attributes described as extra bytes (10 and up)  
  H : a hexadecimal string encoding the RGB color  
  J : a hexadecimal string encoding the intensity  

### output separator
The '-osep [sep]' argument specifies the output format of a text(xyz or csv) output.
Supported [sep] values:

  comma
  tab
  dot
  colon
  semicolon
  hyphen
  space
