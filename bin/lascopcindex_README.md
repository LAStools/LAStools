# lascopcindex

This tool creates a COPC *.laz file version 1.4 format 6, 7 or 8
for a given set of *.las or *.laz files. A COPC file is a LAZ 1.4
file that stores point data sorted and organized in a clustered octree. 
It contains a VLR that describes the octree organization of data that
are stored in LAZ 1.4 chunks (https://copc.io/).
When COPC index is present it will be used to speed up access to the
relevant areas of the LAZ file whenever a spatial queries or depth
queries of the type
    -inside_tile ll_x ll_y size
    -inside_circle center_x center_y radius
    -inside_rectangle min_x min_y max_x max_y  (or simply -inside)
    -max_depth d
    -resolution r
appears in the command line of any LAStools invocation. 
This acceleration is also available to users of the LASlib API. 
The LASreader class has four new functions called
    BOOL inside_tile(const F32 ll_x, const F32 ll_y, const F32 size);
    BOOL inside_circle(const F64 center_x, const F64 center_y, const F64 radius);
    BOOL inside_rectangle(const F64 min_x, const F64 min_y, const F64 max_x, const F64 max_y);
    BOOL inside_copc_depth(const U8 mode, const I32 depth, const F32 resolution);
If any of these functions is called the LASreader will only return the points
that fall inside the specified region or depth and use - when available - the spatial
indexing information in the COPC EVLR.

# Examples

    lascopcindex64 in.las

creates a COPC file called 'in.copc.laz'.

    lascopcindex64 -i in.laz -o out.copc.laz

creates a COPC file called 'out.copc.laz'.

    lascopcindex64 -i *.las

converts all LAS files in the current folder into copc files. The COPC
format is designed to store massive point clouds in a single file so
this may not be the typical use case. See the next example for more details.

    lascopcindex64 -merged -i *.laz -o out.copc.laz

creates a single COPC LAZ file by merging all input LAZ files, which has 
the potential to be massive in size. However, creating such a large file 
may put significant pressure on the memory (RAM) resources. The amount of 
memory required depends on the density and extent of the point clouds, as 
well as the spatial coherence of the points in the files. Here are the order 
of magnitudes for memory usage based on different scenarios:

For spatially coherent streams:
- 10 million points: approximately 500 MB
- 100 million points: approximately 2 GB
- 1 billion points: approximately 5 GB

For non-spatially coherent streams:
- 10 million points: approximately 800 MB
- 50 million points: approximately 7 GB
- 1 billion points: not tested

To mitigate the memory usage, there are options available to reduce the memory footprint.
See -unordered, -tls and -ondisk examples.

    lascopcindex64 -merged -i *.laz -o out.copc.laz -progress

building a massive COPC LAZ file is a time-consuming process. This option displays a progress bar.

    lascopcindex64 -merged -i *.laz -o out.copc.laz -ft

If the point clouds are not in meters, users have the option to specify the units using 
either the default option "-m" (meters) or the "-ft" option (feet). Not providing the "-ft" 
option is not a significant issue, but if users choose to provide it, it might slightly 
improve the speed and memory usage. long/lat coordinates are not supported by the COPC standard.

    lascopcindex64 -merged -i *.laz -o out.copc.laz -root_light

The root of the octree can be more or less populated with -root_light, -root_medium (default) or -root_dense

    lascopcindex64 -merged -i *.laz -o out.copc.laz -root_light -keep_first

Make a COPC file from first return only with a lower density at each level of the octree.

    lascopcindex64 -i in.laz -o tls.copc.laz -unordered

optimized algorithm for processing files that are not spatially coherent. It may be slightly slower but
it offers the advantage of using at least to 2 times less memory compared to the standard algorithm. It 
is specifically designed for dense point clouds obtained from sources such as drone, terrestrial lidar, 
photogrammetry, and other non-spatially coherent acquisitions. Works only for a single input file.

    lascopcindex64 -i tls.laz -tls

This is equivalent to -unordered -root_light. Additionally, the internal routine variation for computing 
the maximum depth of the octree is specifically tailored to handle terrestrial lidar data more effectively.

    lascopcindex64 -merge -i *.laz -o out.copc.laz -ondisk

When sorting and clustering massive point clouds, it can exert a significant strain on the main memory (RAM). 
To alleviate this memory pressure, an option is available to store temporary data on disk, reducing the memory 
usage. By storing the data on disk, the memory usage can be reduced by 2 or more, although it may lead to an increase 
in processing time.
