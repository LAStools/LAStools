# geotiffinfo

This tiny tool informs about all header fields in a GeoTIFF file.
Other TIFF tools just report the well known TIFF tags. This tool
also analyzes and reports the GeoKey directory entries.
  
## Examples

    geotiffinfo in.tif
or
    geotiffinfo -i in.tif

outputs the header information of a TIFF file include the GeoTIFF tags and their interpretation:

  Sample Format: IEEE floating point
  Compression Scheme: LZW
  Photometric Interpretation: min-is-black
