  There are TWO parts of LAStools. One part is open source. 
  The other part is closed source and requires licensing for most 
  commercial or government use. If you're unsure please email 
  'info@rapidlasso.de' before using LAStools.
  For education and evaluation purposes you can use and test LAStools 
  for free. Some free version tools are limited in the maximum count
  of lidar points in one single file to avoid commercial usage.

  This part of LAStools is "free" open-source (see COPYING.txt).
